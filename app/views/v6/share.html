      <p>Now send your suggested plan to {{ data['first-name-other-adult'] }}.</p>

      <p>We've sent a copy of your plan to yourname@email.com</p>



      <p>You can:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><a href="plan-text-document">View your plan</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Download an editable text format copy</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Email a copy</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Print a copy</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>You'll both need to be in agreement to finish the child arrangements plan. It's best to get agreement in writing, even if it's just on an email.</p>

      <p>Remember, although it's best to agree changes to your arrangements without going to court, only your original court order can be enforced.</p>
