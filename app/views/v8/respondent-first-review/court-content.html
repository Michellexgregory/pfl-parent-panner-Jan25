      <p>If you have an order in place that sets out restrictions on contact with your children or ex-partner, do not use this service.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
This type of order may include:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>a prohibited steps order</li>
  <li>a specific issue order</li>
  <li>a non-molestation order</li>
  <li>a no contact order</li>
</ul>

<p>Check any legal documents sent to you by a court to see whether you have any of these types of restrictions.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you do not have any restrictions on contact</h2>
<p>If you do not have any restrictions on contact with your children or ex-partner, you can use this service.</p>

<p>You can use this service to change child arrangements given to you by a court, so long as the other parent or carer agrees with the changes. You do not need to go back to court to change your arrangements. However, a court can only enforce the child arrangements that are in your court order.</p>
