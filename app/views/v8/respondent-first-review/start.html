      <p>This service helps you work out your child arrangements without having to go to court.</p>
      <p>You’ll end up with a proposed plan that you can share with another parent or carer to ask their agreement.</p>

      <p>Use this service to propose:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>where your children live</li>
        <li>when your children spend time with each parent</li>
        <li>handovers, holidays and whatever else matters to your children</li>
      </ul>

     
      <p>This service is useful if:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>you are separated or divorced from your children’s other parent and have no child arrangements plan in place yet</li>
        <li>you want to propose changes to your existing arrangements, even if you have a court order in place</li>
      </ul>
