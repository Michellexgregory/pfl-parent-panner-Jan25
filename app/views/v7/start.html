        About this service
      </h2> -->
      

      <p>This service helps you work out your child arrangements without having to go to court.</p>
      <p>You’ll end up with a proposed plan that you can share with another parent or carer to ask their agreement.</p>

      <p>Use this service to propose:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>where your children live</li>
        <li>when your children spend time with each parent</li>
        <li>handovers, holidays and whatever else matters to your children</li>
      </ul>

     
      <p>This service is useful if:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>you are separated or divorced from your children’s other parent and have no child arrangements plan in place yet</li>
        <li>you want to propose changes to your existing arrangements, even if you have a court order in place</li>
      </ul>

      <!--<p>Do not use this service if:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>there’s been any domestic abuse</li>
        <li>you have concerns about child abuse or neglect</li>
        <li>the other parent has a drug or alcohol problem that's affecting your children</li>
      </ul>


      <p>A parenting plan is a written plan to prepare, discuss and agree arrangements. It's not legally binding but it can help you make plans that meet your children's needs.</p>

      <p>Using a parenting plan:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>helps you know what's expected of you</li>
        <li>confirms your agreements (for example, where your children will live)</li>
        <li>works as a record for you to go back to</li>
      </ul>-->
