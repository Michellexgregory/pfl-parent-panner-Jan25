      <p>Now send your suggested plan to Heather.</p>



      <p>You can:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><a href="#">Download a copy</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Email a copy</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Print a copy</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>You'll both need to be in agreement to finish the child arrangements plan. It's best to get agreement in writing, even if it's just on an email.</p>

      <p>Remember, although it's best to agree changes to your arrangements without going to court, only your original court order can be enforced.</p>
