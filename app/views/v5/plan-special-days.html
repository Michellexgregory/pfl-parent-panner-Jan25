      <p>Which special days are important to you? </p>

      <p>For example, New Year celebrations, Mother’s day, UK bank holidays.</p> 

      <p>You should also consider holidays that don’t happen every year, such as an extra bank holiday to celebrate a royal event. </p>

      <p>You may also want to think about family birthdays and special events such as graduation ceremonies or military homecomings.</p>
